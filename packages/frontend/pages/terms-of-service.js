            NFT is a very new term in the digital world. And most of the people
            don't really know what the NFT really is. We just provide the tool
            for you to create a NFT (token) with a metadata to link to your
            (own) media or any other digital contents. That's it. When you own
            the token, you are the owner of the token. It doesn't really mean
            you are the owner or creater of the original contents. Everyone
            should be ware of the copyright issues and the NFT legally means.
            This tool or service is just help you to create a NFT from your
            posted media on Instagram or Facebook.
